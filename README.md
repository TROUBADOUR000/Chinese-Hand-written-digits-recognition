Hand-Written Digits Recognition by CNN & SVM

The MNIST dataset is one of the most classical datasets in handwritten digit recognition problems. However, because it comes from the National Institute of Standards and Technology of the US, the digital writing is not rich enough to meet the standard of Chinese people's writing habits making it difficult to identify the correct effect in some cases. The main purpose of this project is to train a CNN model using the expanded handwritten numerals dataset to adapt to Chinese writing habits and improve the recognition effect.
